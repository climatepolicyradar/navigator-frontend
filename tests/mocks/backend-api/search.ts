Spitsen</p>\n<p>NREL’s annual offshore wind energy market assessment outlines the global and U.S. offshore wind energy industries’ current state and trends. The researchers’ key findings for the U.S. offshore wind energy market include:- The pipeline grew in 2023 by 53% to a potential generating capacity of 80.5 GW, which, when built, would be enough to power about 28 million American homes.- The first commercial-scale offshore wind power plant in the United States began delivering power from near Rhode Island (fully commissioned March 14, 2024).- Three projects under construction in the Atlantic are expected to add 4.1 GW to the U.S. capacity.- New lease areas were proposed in the Gulf of Maine, along Oregon’s coast, and in the Gulf of Mexico, expanding the total capacity and the industry beyond the Atlantic Ocean to include floating offshore wind farm development, which has 25 GW in the pipeline.- Procurement goals for offshore wind energy in eight states include a total of 45.7 GW of wind energy capacity by 2040.- $10 billion has been announced or invested in the U.S. offshore wind energy supply chain, including support for ports, vessels, and workforce, increasing investor confidence.- Contracts have been signed for offshore wind farms to provide 12.4 GW of energy through 15 contracts in multiple states.The key findings, from a global perspective, on the offshore wind energy market include:- New offshore wind installations in 2023 increased global capacity to over 68 GW of offshore wind energy from 319 operating projects, which host over 13,000 operating turbines.- Of that capacity, 0.23 GW comes from floating structures, nearly double last year.- With additional projects in various stages of planning and development, the offshore wind energy capacity in the pipeline totals more than 453.6 GW, with 104.4 GW from floating structures.View further information about the annual Offshore Wind Market Reports and previous publications on <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/wind/offshore-market-assessment.html" target="_blank"><ins>NREL\'s website</ins></a>.</p>',

Hein</p>\n<p>This report summarises currently available information on available infrastructure, environmental factors, and community readiness as related to offshore wind energy transmission planning in the Gulf of Mexico. In the report, the authors state that:- Prior to this effort, researchers had not studied offshore wind energy transmission in the Gulf of Mexico—this research is needed to inform regional transmission planning and adequately meet regional and future energy needs.- The oil and gas industry already has infrastructure and workers positioned in the Gulf of Mexico; new offshore wind energy projects could be supported through shared transmission systems and workforce.- Future transmission planning must consider the Gulf of Mexico\'s highly productive ecosystem, diverse coastal communities, considerable existing infrastructure, and heavy industrial foundation.- Transmission solutions should be tailored to regional environmental concerns to minimize impacts to wildlife, habitat, and coastal resources.- Transmission projects should include local communities in their planning efforts.Overall, the researchers found that transmission projects will require collaborative, coordinated planning across multiple diverse groups, including federal, Tribal, state, and local entities, to ensure new projects help meet evolving decarbonization and clean energy goals.View further information about this research project on <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/wind/gulf-of-mexico-offshore-wind-transmission.html" target="_blank"><ins>NREL\'s website</ins></a>.</p>',

Abdelmala</p>\n<p>This study identifies and evaluates pathways to enable offshore wind energy deployment in the Atlantic Ocean through coordinated offshore transmission solutions in the near term (by 2030) and long term (by 2050). The study fills gaps in prior analyses by providing a multiregional planning perspective that evaluates offshore wind generation development with transmission planning. It incorporates environmental, ocean co-use, and other siting considerations into defining potential offshore transmission routes. The study also compares different multiregional offshore transmission topologies and their associated costs (using potential cable routes) and benefits (in terms of production cost savings and enhanced resource adequacy). In addition, the study analyzes reliability impacts from a multiregional perspective. The study provides guidance for policymakers and transmission stakeholders on possible outcomes resulting from a proactive, coordinated, and interregional approach to transmission planning for offshore wind energy development in the Atlantic. While this study presents possibilities, additional work following system operator methods and procedures can help build on this analysis.View further information about this study on <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/wind/atlantic-offshore-wind-transmission-study.html" target="_blank"><ins>NREL\'s website</ins></a>.</p>',

We summarize the major barriers that could prevent or delay supply chain expansion and present potential solutions that could help overcome these challenges. We describe the major factors that need to be considered to develop resilient, sustainable, and equitable manufacturing capabilities in the United States. Finally, we present a scenario for a domestic supply chain that estimates the number of required major component manufacturing facilities, ports, and vessels that would need to be developed by 2030 to support an annual deployment of 4–6 GW.

Lim</p>\n<p>In this report, the authors present analyses and perspectives related to port development in California, Oregon, and Washington. They describe the requirements for floating offshore wind ports that conduct manufacturing, installation, and/or service activities, and estimate the investment and time frames required to construct these ports at suitable locations in West Coast states. They develop indicators for the vulnerability and workforce accessibility of coastal communities and consider the potential risks and benefits associated with port development in these locations. THey model how the proximity of an offshore wind project to installation and operations ports can impact the levelized cost of energy of the project, and then consider how these costs could be affected by local or foreign supply chains. They build upon these analyses to develop scenarios with increasing levels of offshore wind deployment and port assets on the West Coast and show how these ports could enable deployment goals to be achieved. Finally, they draw upon outreach with key floating wind stakeholders to summarize five key challenges that will need to be overcome to develop a comprehensive port network, and present potential approaches that could help to address these obstacles.
