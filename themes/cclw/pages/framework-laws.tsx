                We assign a number of classifications and categories to laws and policies in the Climate Change Laws of the World database to enhance
                the usability and searchability of the data. The system of classifications has evolved to remain in step with developments in climate
                governance, the growth of the dataset, and the needs of our user community.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have identified a discrete class of laws which we refer to as <strong>'climate change framework laws'</strong>, a term that is
                applied with increasing frequency by the academic and policy community to laws that share some or all of the following
                characteristics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Set out the strategic direction of travel for national climate change policy</li>
                <li>Are passed by the legislative branch of government</li>
                <li>Contain national long-term and/or medium targets and/or pathways for change</li>
                <li>Set out institutional arrangements for climate governance at the national level</li>
                <li>Are multi-sectoral in scope</li>
                <li>Involve mechanisms for transparency and/or accountability.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The laws are tagged to indicate the policy response area(s) to which they relate, whether mitigation, adaptation and/or disaster risk
                management.
