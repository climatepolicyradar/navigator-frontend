        <p>
          The Multilateral Climate Funds (MCFs) have created this joint platform as a single-entry point to access and explore the MCFs project
          documents and policies. It is designed to enhance your experience and provide new features to help you navigate and interact with the data
          from all the funds in one place. This platform is not intended to replace the MCFs’ respective websites and databases, which remain
          operational.
        </p>
        <p>Key features of the platform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct searches in the database using the full text of documents. This improves the comprehensiveness of your search results.</li>
          <li>
            Find relevant information more easily. The new search function looks for similar and related phrases to search queries (‘semantic
            search’).
          </li>
          <li>
            See where a search term or relevant text appears in a document, with relevant passages of text automatically highlighted in yellow to help
            you quickly identify important information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search for and explore documents from various MCF websites, including the Adaptation Fund, Climate Investment Funds, Global Environment
            Facility and Green Climate Fund.

        <p>
          The Multilateral Climate Funds (MCFs) Climate Project Explorer (CPE) is a publicly accessible platform that consolidates data from the four
          multilateral climate funds into a comprehensive knowledge resource. It aims to raise awareness of the MCFs’ efforts, value, and impact and
          facilitate the exchange of information to enhance access to the funds and promote transparency. Explore the platform to gain valuable
          insights into climate projects and programmes and their significance.

        <p>
          Climate Policy Radar (CPR) is a UK not-for-profit, which is organising, analysing and democratising data for climate action, who publish the
          Climate Policy Radar app. CPR has partnered with the Multilateral Climate Funds to launch the Climate Project Explorer, using CPR’s
          technology to help you get more out of MCF’s data. These resources have the same data, features and functionality.

        <p>
          The database is not exhaustive. We don't have access to some MCF documents. Others aren't currently machine-readable: we can't yet extract
          the text from them. We also limit the number of matches you can see in a document to 500, so you get quickest, most accurate results. For
          very long documents, or very broad search terms, you might miss some matches.
