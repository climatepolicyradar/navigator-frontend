                  <strong>The Adaptation Fund</strong> (AF) finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries
                  adapt to climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed over $1.2 billion for climate change adaptation and resilience projects and programs,
                  including over 175 concrete, localized projects in the most vulnerable communities of developing countries around the world with
                  over 43 million total beneficiaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  About half of its projects are in Least Developed Countries or Small Island Developing States. It also pioneered Direct Access and
                  Enhanced Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop local projects directly through accredited national
                  implementing entities.

                  <strong>The Climate Investment Funds</strong> (CIF) is a major multilateral climate fund established in 2008 to finance
                  climate-smart solutions in developing countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It operates exclusively through six AAA-rated multilateral development banks, providing large-scale, low-cost, long-term financing
                  to reduce risks and costs of climate investment. So far, 15 contributor countries have pledged over US$12 billion, unlocking more
                  than $64 billion in additional financing across over 80 countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CIF's country-led, flexible, and inclusive approach has successfully built track records in unproven green markets, incentivized
                  governments to make bold investment decisions, and crowded in additional sources of finance for pioneering climate solutions.

                  <strong>The Global Environment Facility</strong> (GEF) is a multilateral family of funds dedicated to confronting biodiversity loss,
                  climate change, and pollution, and supporting land and ocean health.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Its financing enables developing countries to address complex challenges and work towards international environmental goals. The
                  partnership includes 186 member governments as well as civil society, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth, with a focus on
                  integration and inclusivity.

                <p>
                  Over the past three decades, the GEF has provided more than $25 billion in financing and mobilized $145 billion for country-driven
                  priority projects. The family of funds includes the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund,
