                Since its creation in 2009, the{" "}
                <ExternalLink url="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/">Sabin Center for Climate Change Law</ExternalLink> at Columbia Law School has
                been known as a center of expertise, providing timely information and resources on key topics and promoting advances in the
                interrelated fields of climate change law, environmental regulation, energy regulation and natural resources law. The core mission of
                the Sabin Center is to develop and promulgate legal techniques to combat the climate crisis and advance climate justice, and to train
                the next generation of leaders in the field. The Center is both a partner to and a resource for those engaged in climate change work,
                and promotes government and private sector accountability through the compilation and dissemination of information for academic and
                practitioner communities. The Sabin Center is an affiliated center of the{" "}
                <ExternalLink url="https://www.climate.columbia.edu/">Columbia Climate School</ExternalLink>, and frequently collaborates with their

              <p className="text-content mb-6">
                <ExternalLink url="https://climatepolicyradar.org/">Climate Policy Radar</ExternalLink> is a non-profit organisation building open
                databases and research tools so people can discover and understand complex information, in particular long-text documents, on climate,
                nature and development. Our data and tools help governments, researchers, international organisations, civil society, and the private
                sector to understand and advance effective climate policies and deploy climate finance. Harnessing data science and AI, and pioneering
                the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work renders previously unstructured, siloed data more readable and
                accessible.
