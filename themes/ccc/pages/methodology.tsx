                What counts as a climate case?
              </Heading>
              <p>To fall within the scope of the Sabin Center's Climate Litigation Database, cases must satisfy two key criteria:</p>
              <p>
                <strong>1. Judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings</strong>. Cases must generally be brought before judicial bodies. However, in
                certain instances, matters brought before administrative or investigatory bodies and arbitral tribunals are also included. In
                addition, the database includes certain proceedings before international or regional bodies where climate change is materially at
                issue. These include, for example, proceedings before United Nations human rights treaty bodies, compliance committees established
                under multilateral environmental agreements, or other UN mechanisms addressing climate-related obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Material climate relevance</strong>. Climate change law, policy, and/or science must be a material issue of law or fact in
                the case. Cases that make only a passing reference to climate change, without addressing climate-relevant laws, policies, or actions
                in a meaningful way, are excluded.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, cases that may affect climate change outcomes but do not explicitly raise climate-related issues are also excluded.
                Examples include challenges to government inaction on local air pollution or challenges to the development of fossil fuel
                infrastructure based solely on non-climate harm (e.g., public health and/or environmental harm associated with the infrastructure).
                The intent of the litigants regarding the climate-related consequences of such cases is not considered when assessing whether a case
                falls within the database's scope. Notably, such cases could be added later if climate issues become central (for example, if a ruling
                explicitly addresses climate change).
              </p>
              <p>
                The database also includes a number of cases before arbitral tribunals under bilateral and multilateral investment agreements
                (commonly referred to as Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS. Investor-state cases are included when they relate directly to
                the enactment or withdrawal of a domestic measure explicitly adopted to meet a country's climate goals and objectives. For more
                information on these cases and their inclusion in the database, please visit{" "}

              <p>
                Until September 2025, the Sabin Center maintained separate U.S. and Global climate litigation databases. These differed in scope. In
                the U.S. database, "cases" historically included quasi-judicial proceedings, rulemaking petitions, requests for reconsideration of
                regulations, notices of intent to sue (even in situations where lawsuits were not subsequently filed), and subpoenas. Since 2018,
                these other types of U.S. cases generally have not been added to the database, and approximately 135 older entries of this type have
                been removed. As of September 2025, all such entries had been removed.

                How are cases organized?
              </Heading>
              <p>
                <em>Categorization</em> refers to the way cases are organized in the database through a set of descriptive tags. These tags capture
                key features of each case—such as the type of claim, the laws invoked, the jurisdiction, and—in some cases—its status—so that users
                can filter, compare, and analyze cases across jurisdictions. Because the U.S. and Global databases were originally developed
                separately, the tagging systems are not yet fully harmonized. The categorization processes involved similar but slightly different
                components. The lists below describe the categorization systems currently applied for cases outside the U.S. and for U.S. cases,
                pending full integration.
              </p>
              <p>For cases outside the U.S., categorization considers:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Case category</strong>, including the type of defendant (governments or corporations and individuals) and the main cause of
                  action (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions reduction and trading, environmental assessment and permitting, human rights).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>, including the court, tribunal, or other adjudicatory body before which the case was filed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Geography</strong>, including country, region, Global North or Global South (for analytical purposes).

                <li>
                  <strong>Principal law</strong>, i.e., the main climate-relevant laws invoked.

                  <strong>Case status</strong>, such as pending or decided.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>For U.S. cases, categorization considers:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Case category</strong>, e.g., federal statutory claims, constitutional claims, state law claims, adaptation, carbon offsets
                  and credits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Principal law</strong>, e.g., relevant statutes or doctrines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>, (i.e., the court in which the case was filed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Geography</strong>, i.e., the U.S. state where filed, or "Federal" for cases originating in a federal court not tied to a
                  specific U.S. state (e.g., regional federal circuit courts of appeal).

                A single case may be included in multiple case categories, jurisdictions, or principal laws. Appeals and transfers are linked to the

                What are the limits of the database?
              </Heading>
              <p>
                The database highlights and informs a growing field of climate litigation. While we aim for broad coverage, several limitations
                remain:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Incomplete global coverage.</strong> Language barriers, uneven media reporting, and limited access to court documents mean
                  some jurisdictions are better represented than others. Absence of cases in a jurisdiction does not necessarily mean no litigation
                  has occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consolidation.</strong> In some instances, multiple complaints or petitions have been consolidated into a single entry. For
                  U.S. cases, complaints or petitions that have been consolidated can be viewed together as part of a "collection" or "bundle."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Categorization limits.</strong> Categories such as "government" cover a wide range of actors (national, subnational,
                  agencies, state-owned entities, banks, etc.). We aim to specify implicated institutions wherever possible and may introduce further
                  sub-categories in future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scope of "climate litigation."</strong> Our definition is narrower than in some academic and practitioner literature. These
                  criteria were adopted to ensure consistency, to emphasize cases where climate issues are material to the outcome, and to maintain
                  the distinct field of climate litigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Potential bias.</strong> Some cases are identified with the assistance of pro-climate litigants and allies. These may be
                  documented in greater detail than cases challenging climate action. The Sabin Center is actively working to improve balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Evolving cases.</strong> Some cases that initially meet the inclusion criteria may later evolve so that climate issues are
                  no longer material; these cases remain in the database. Conversely, excluded cases may become relevant if climate issues emerge and
                  will be added to the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ongoing evolution.</strong> Our data collection and categorization processes are continually reviewed and may be modified to
                  capture additional types of litigation. Users will be notified of major methodological updates.
