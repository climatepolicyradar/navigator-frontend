# Running the tests locally

To open the cypress console

```bash
npx cypress open
```

To run tests without console and with default settings,
ensure you are in the e2e directory and have set the THEME, then run

```bash
npx cypress run
```

or alternatively

```bash
THEME=cclw npx cypress run
```
