      (PM2.5), the pollutant most associated with negative health impacts. The impact quantified here are premature deaths associated with PM2.5
      exposure, although air pollution has a much wider effect on health, including non-fatal effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
      In Nigeria in 2010, fine particulate matter exposure was associated with about 61,000 premature deaths with the most affected being children of
      less than 5 years of age. Environmental effects are defined as effects on crops and forests, while climate effects are defined as global warming
      or cooling of the atmosphere.
