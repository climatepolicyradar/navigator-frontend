Following feedback from an EU-wide assessment of draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) submissions, EU members are required to submit updated final NECPs for the period 2021-2030.</p>\n<p>The key objectives outlined in the plan are: 1) overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and 2) increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the gross final energy consumption and energy efficiency, expressed as consumption of primary energy and direct consumption of energy. Different measures concerning decarbonisation, energy efficiency and security are implemented in the electricity, agriculture, building construction, heating, cooling and transport sectors. The plan aims for a 62% reduction in ETS emissions by 2030 relative to 2005, and a 42.5% renewable share of gross final energy consumption by 2030.</p>`,
