          This new feature automatically identifies mentions of key topics in documents, helping you quickly find where important topics like economic
          sectors, targets, and climate finance instruments appear in our database.

        <p>While this feature is more precise than our standard search, accuracy is not 100%.</p>

        <p>Automatically detected topics help you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quickly locate mentions of key topics in documents.</li>
          <li>Understand the primary focus of a document.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, results are not 100% accurate. Be cautious when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Counting how often a topic appears in a document.</li>
          <li>Comparing documents based on topic frequency.</li>

    title: "What happens if I select multiple topics or add a text search?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          When you select more than one topic or combine a topic with a text search, the tool looks for <i>individual passages</i> (short sections of
          text) that include <b>all</b> selected topics and/or keywords together.
        </p>

        <p>Because few passages contain many topics at once, selecting more topics can reduce the number of results — sometimes to zero.</p>

        <p>
          <b>Example:</b> If you choose "target" and "energy sector", you'll only see passages where <i>both</i> appear together, not all documents
          that mention each topic separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're working on improving this feature to support broader searches across entire documents and give you more control over how topics and
          keywords are combined.

    content: (
      <>
        <p>Each detected topic is based on a combination of expert knowledge and automated models:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Expert-driven topic selection</b>: our policy specialists identify the most important topics by looking at existing taxonomies and
            consulting external experts. We maintain a catalogue of these topics in{" "}
            <ExternalLink url="https://climatepolicyradar.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page">our concept store</ExternalLink>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Automated detection</b>: our data scientists and software engineers build models to find these topics in text, continuously refining
            them based on human feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Quality control</b>: before public release, we manually review a sample of results to ensure accuracy.
          </li>

    title: "How accurate are the results?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>Our classifiers are designed to prioritise transparency, meaning we sometimes display uncertain results rather than hide them.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            On average, if a classifier highlights a topic, it is correct in <b>9 out of 10 cases</b>.
          </li>
          <li>Accuracy varies by topic and document quality. For example, if text extraction fails, we cannot accurately detect topics.</li>
          <li>We are actively improving accuracy by refining our models and ensuring consistency across different document types and languages.</li>

    title: "Should I be concerned about the climate impact of this feature?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>We prioritise sustainability in our technology choices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When two models produce similar results, we use the simpler, less energy-intensive option.</li>
          <li>Most of our models rely on efficient keyword-based detection rather than resource-heavy AI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nevertheless, we’re working to measure, minimise, and report on the precise energy intensity of our data science work.</p>
