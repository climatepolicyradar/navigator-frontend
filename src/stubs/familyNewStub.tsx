The court also rejected the defendants’ contentions that litigation costs and “potential, intrusive discovery that treads on separation of powers grounds” would result in irreparable injury if a stay was not granted to resolve threshold jurisdictional issues. The court further found that the plaintiffs had provided “substantial evidence of tangible, irreparable injury brought about the defendants’ repeated delays,” with “[e]xpert and plaintiff declarations … establish[ing] an ever-worsening climate crisis and with it, risks to plaintiffs’ health, their future, and their constitutional due process rights.” The court also stated that it could not discern any public interest in further delaying the case from reaching the evidentiary phase.",

          "The federal district court for the District of Oregon denied in part the federal government’s motion to dismiss youth plaintiffs’ amended complaint asserting that federal defendants violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to a stable climate system. The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that they did not have standing because courts could not redress the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The district court first reconsidered its June 2023 determination that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not foreclose allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint; the district court again concluded that allowing the plaintiffs to amend did not contravene the rule of mandate. Regarding the plaintiffs’ standing, the district court first adopted the Ninth Circuit’s determination that the plaintiffs established an injury in fact arising from climate change impacts that was fairly traceable to defendants. Regarding redressability, the district court noted that the plaintiffs had “scaled back” their request for injunctive relief by removing a request for a directive requiring the defendants to “prepare a remedial plan” and instead seeking to restrain the defendants “from carrying out policies, practices, and affirmative actions that render the national energy system unconstitutional in a manner that harms [p]laintiffs.” The court found that such relief was substantially likely to redress the plaintiffs’ harm but that even this narrower request for injunctive relief “still treads on ground over which [the] Ninth Circuit cautioned the Court not to step” because the relief was sought “against a host of governmental defendants” and “would be more expansive than any case of which the Court is aware.” The court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs’ requested declaratory relief—i.e., a declaration that “the national energy system” violates the Constitution and public trust doctrine—“may be enough to bring about relief by changed conduct” and that the defendants failed to show that such relief was outside the court’s authority. The court also found that “the political question doctrine does not impede plaintiffs’ claims.” Regarding the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ due process claim for failure to state a claim, the district court found “that the right to a climate system that can sustain human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society” and that the allegations that governmental action was damaging the climate system in a way that would result in harm to humans stated a claim for a due process violation. The district court also found that the plaintiffs stated a “danger creation” due process claim with their allegations that the defendants failed to adequately regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of third parties. The court also incorporated its earlier analysis concluding that plaintiffs alleged violations of the public trust doctrine in connection with the territorial sea. The court also rejected the defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs were required to bring their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court dismissed, however, the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, finding it to be foreclosed by precedent holding that age is not a suspect class. The court also held that the plaintiffs’ claim under the Ninth Amendment was not viable. The court denied the defendants’ requests to certify for interlocutory appellate review this decision and its earlier decision allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The court also denied the defendants’ motion to stay the litigation and granted the plaintiffs’ motion to set a pretrial conference.",

          "More than three years after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States lacked standing for their claims that federal defendants violated their constitutionally protected rights to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human life, the federal district court for the District of Oregon granted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint to attempt to cure what the district court characterized as “a narrow deficiency with plaintiffs’ pleadings on redressability.” The district court concluded that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not require the court “to shut the courthouse doors” on the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs cited intervening precedent and made new factual allegations. In particular, the plaintiffs cited a 2021 Supreme Court decision that held that judicial ability to “to effectuate a partial remedy” satisfies the redressability requirement for standing. The plaintiffs contended that their amended allegations demonstrated that relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act would provide sufficient partial redress of their climate change-related injuries. The plaintiffs also omitted relief that the Ninth Circuit found to be outside the scope of judicial authority, including a request for an order requiring the defendants to develop and implement a remedial plan. The district court found that the proposed amendments were not futile, concluding that “a declaration that federal defendants’ energy policies violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would itself be significant relief” and that such relief was “squarely within the constitutional and statutory power of Article III courts to grant.” The court therefore found “that the complaint can be saved by amendment.”",

The states sought to intervene in 2021 to oppose the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their complaint after the Ninth Circuit ruled that they did not have standing. The court granted the states leave to refile their motions to intervene after the court rules on the pending motion to amend. On the same day, the court granted New York and five other states’ motion for leave to file a brief as amici curiae to “correct” the proposed state intervenors’ “erroneous assertions” about collusion between plaintiffs and federal defendants in other cases and the proposed intervenors’ “incomplete picture” of the impacts on states of federal action to address climate change. The court also granted Natural Resources Defense Council’s motion for leave to file an amicus brief opposing the states’ motion to intervene.",

              "The federal district court for the District of Oregon denied in part the federal government’s motion to dismiss youth plaintiffs’ amended complaint asserting that federal defendants violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to a stable climate system. The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that they did not have standing because courts could not redress the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The district court first reconsidered its June 2023 determination that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not foreclose allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint; the district court again concluded that allowing the plaintiffs to amend did not contravene the rule of mandate. Regarding the plaintiffs’ standing, the district court first adopted the Ninth Circuit’s determination that the plaintiffs established an injury in fact arising from climate change impacts that was fairly traceable to defendants. Regarding redressability, the district court noted that the plaintiffs had “scaled back” their request for injunctive relief by removing a request for a directive requiring the defendants to “prepare a remedial plan” and instead seeking to restrain the defendants “from carrying out policies, practices, and affirmative actions that render the national energy system unconstitutional in a manner that harms [p]laintiffs.” The court found that such relief was substantially likely to redress the plaintiffs’ harm but that even this narrower request for injunctive relief “still treads on ground over which [the] Ninth Circuit cautioned the Court not to step” because the relief was sought “against a host of governmental defendants” and “would be more expansive than any case of which the Court is aware.” The court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs’ requested declaratory relief—i.e., a declaration that “the national energy system” violates the Constitution and public trust doctrine—“may be enough to bring about relief by changed conduct” and that the defendants failed to show that such relief was outside the court’s authority. The court also found that “the political question doctrine does not impede plaintiffs’ claims.” Regarding the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ due process claim for failure to state a claim, the district court found “that the right to a climate system that can sustain human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society” and that the allegations that governmental action was damaging the climate system in a way that would result in harm to humans stated a claim for a due process violation. The district court also found that the plaintiffs stated a “danger creation” due process claim with their allegations that the defendants failed to adequately regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of third parties. The court also incorporated its earlier analysis concluding that plaintiffs alleged violations of the public trust doctrine in connection with the territorial sea. The court also rejected the defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs were required to bring their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court dismissed, however, the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, finding it to be foreclosed by precedent holding that age is not a suspect class. The court also held that the plaintiffs’ claim under the Ninth Amendment was not viable. The court denied the defendants’ requests to certify for interlocutory appellate review this decision and its earlier decision allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The court also denied the defendants’ motion to stay the litigation and granted the plaintiffs’ motion to set a pretrial conference.",

The court also rejected the defendants’ contentions that litigation costs and “potential, intrusive discovery that treads on separation of powers grounds” would result in irreparable injury if a stay was not granted to resolve threshold jurisdictional issues. The court further found that the plaintiffs had provided “substantial evidence of tangible, irreparable injury brought about the defendants’ repeated delays,” with “[e]xpert and plaintiff declarations … establish[ing] an ever-worsening climate crisis and with it, risks to plaintiffs’ health, their future, and their constitutional due process rights.” The court also stated that it could not discern any public interest in further delaying the case from reaching the evidentiary phase.",

              "More than three years after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States lacked standing for their claims that federal defendants violated their constitutionally protected rights to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human life, the federal district court for the District of Oregon granted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint to attempt to cure what the district court characterized as “a narrow deficiency with plaintiffs’ pleadings on redressability.” The district court concluded that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not require the court “to shut the courthouse doors” on the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs cited intervening precedent and made new factual allegations. In particular, the plaintiffs cited a 2021 Supreme Court decision that held that judicial ability to “to effectuate a partial remedy” satisfies the redressability requirement for standing. The plaintiffs contended that their amended allegations demonstrated that relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act would provide sufficient partial redress of their climate change-related injuries. The plaintiffs also omitted relief that the Ninth Circuit found to be outside the scope of judicial authority, including a request for an order requiring the defendants to develop and implement a remedial plan. The district court found that the proposed amendments were not futile, concluding that “a declaration that federal defendants’ energy policies violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would itself be significant relief” and that such relief was “squarely within the constitutional and statutory power of Article III courts to grant.” The court therefore found “that the complaint can be saved by amendment.”",

The defendants argued that the amended complaint was “not different in any relevant sense” from the complaint rejected by the Ninth Circuit and that the court therefore should comply with the Ninth Circuit’s mandate and dismiss the amended complaint. In addition, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not allege a redressable claim, that the action was not a case or controversy over which a federal court would have jurisdiction, and that the plaintiffs’ claims based on constitutional violations and an alleged public trust failed on the merits because the Constitution does not provide a fundamental right to a “stable climate system” and no federal public trust doctrine applies.

The states sought to intervene in 2021 to oppose the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their complaint after the Ninth Circuit ruled that they did not have standing. The court granted the states leave to refile their motions to intervene after the court rules on the pending motion to amend. On the same day, the court granted New York and five other states’ motion for leave to file a brief as amici curiae to “correct” the proposed state intervenors’ “erroneous assertions” about collusion between plaintiffs and federal defendants in other cases and the proposed intervenors’ “incomplete picture” of the impacts on states of federal action to address climate change. The court also granted Natural Resources Defense Council’s motion for leave to file an amicus brief opposing the states’ motion to intervene.",
